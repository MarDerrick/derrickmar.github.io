        <p>I find the topic around <strong><a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-game-development>game development</a></strong> interesting. <strong> Game development</strong> is a very broad subject that
            can have a variety of meaning. There is a variety of ways that different computer graphics create a variety of games.
            The different aspects of graphics include the likes of <strong>text-based, vector, 2D, and 3D</strong> graphics which
            can define a game.
